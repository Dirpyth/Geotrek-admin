Required Super User
-------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    docker-compose run --rm web ./manage.py createsuperuser

This first user will allow you to login in Geotrek, having all permissions to create and manage other users.


Prerequisites for your data
---------------------------

Layers
~~~~~~

* WMTS (scan + ortho)
* Projection
* Bounding box in native projection

Core
~~~~

* Only LineString geometries
* Simple geometries
* Not overlapping

If possible :

* Connex graph
* Name column
* Data source

Formats: Shapefile or pure SQL dump SQL (CREATE TABLE + INSERT)


Land
~~~~

* Cities polygons (Shapefile or SQL, simple and valid Multi-Polygons)
* Districts (Shapefile ou SQL, simple and valid Multi-Polygons)
* Restricted Areas (Shapefile ou SQL, simple and valid Multi-Polygons)

Load MNT raster
---------------

`In QGIS <http://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/training_manual/processing/cutting_merging.html>`_,
you can visualize your DEM, or merge several tiles together (in *Raster* > *Misc* > *Merge*).

Generate a GeoTIFF, and upload both files (``.tif`` + ``.tfw``) on the server.
And use the Geotrek command to load it into PostGIS :


::

    docker-compose run --rm web ./manage.py loaddem <PATH>/dem.tif


:note:

    This command makes use of *GDAL* and ``raster2pgsql`` internally. It
    therefore supports all GDAL raster input formats. You can list these formats
    with the command ``docker-compose run --rm web raster2pgsql -G``.
    
:note:

    If you only have a ``.tif`` file, you can generate the ``.tfw`` file with the command ``gdal_translate -co "TFW=YES" in.tif out.tif``. It will generate a new ``.tif`` file with its ``.tfw`` metadata file.
